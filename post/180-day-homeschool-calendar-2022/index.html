        <p>The day allows godchildren and their families to honor godparents and the role they take in the children&#039;s lives. Veteran’s day is an important observance in the united states, set aside for honoring and remembering men and women who have served in the armed forces. If you can relate, then rest assured that you&#039;re about to find yourself in good company.</p>
